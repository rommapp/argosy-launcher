## What is Argosy?

Argosy is a launcher designed for retro gaming handhelds like Anbernic, Retroid Pocket, and Odin devices. It serves as a native Android client for [RomM](https://github.com/rommapp/romm), the self-hosted ROM manager, bringing your entire game library to your handheld with a gamepad-first interface.

## Key Features

### Native RomM Integration
First-class client for RomM self-hosted game library. Sync your entire collection with rich metadata sourced from IGDB, including cover art, descriptions, genres, and more.

### Hassle-Free ROM Management
No manual folder organization required. Games are automatically sorted by platform when downloaded from your RomM server.

### Direct Downloads
Download games from your RomM server directly to your device. Queue multiple downloads and track progress as they complete.

### Smart Emulator Detection
Argosy auto-detects 40+ installed emulators and launches the appropriate one for each platform. Supports standalone emulators and RetroArch cores.

### Gamepad-First Design
Built for controller navigation from the ground up. Browse your library, download games, and launch emulators without touching the screen.

### Library Filtering
Browse your collection by genre, player count, franchise, or region. Find multiplayer games for a session or filter to your favorite series.

## Supported Platforms

NES, SNES, N64, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS, Switch, PlayStation, PS2, PSP, Dreamcast, Saturn, Genesis, Arcade, DOS, ScummVM, and many more.
